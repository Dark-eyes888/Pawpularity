# Pawpularity/ComputerVision
This is my first repository. It consists of my work from the Kaggle Pawpularity Competition. The basic task was to rank thousands of pet photos according to their cuteness.

I have used Ensemble Transfer Learning to predict the ranks of these pets.

Kindly share your views on my work and help me improve on my AI journey.
